#project description:
    Hiking Trails allows users to find hiking trails using filters like their locations, trail difficulty, ratings and more. After the user finds a trail that they are interested in, they can review the description of the trail, find out the weather and see other attractions in the area. The user can save their list of favorite hikes. 

#Sketch: 
    The home page has a search bar where user searches for a hike according to their preferred filters. When the users search for the hike, they will get a list of options. When they click on their preferred option, they enter a page with all the details of their hike. They can later save the hike into their favorites list.
